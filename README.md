This project is dedicated to Robert L. Brock and Aaron Fechter, who's Showbiz Pizza Place blew my mind as a young child, instilled in me a facination with animitronics, and even broadened my appreciation of music.

I honestly don't remember anything about their food.

After seeing all sorts of "animated" Halloween decorations that were complete garbage for insane amounts of money,  I decided I was going to build my own animitronics... Somehow.  I thought and planned and came to the conclusion it would be way too much work for something I was only going to show off one day a year.  Then I thought about alternatives to skelletons and scarecrows, and as I was dreaming up alternatives, I remembered a gorrila, bear, mouse, and other assorted critters that had started a band.  It was perfect, I could make animals that I could then dress in costumes and have sing different songs for the various holidays.

Unfortunately, I'm not an engenier, or a CAD designer, so I'm sure most of what I've done can be done better, but as I was explaining what I was doing to my daughter, I thought this would be a great STEAM project, heck, it would be a great project for everyone!  So here were are, a (hopefully) simple animitronic you can build at home.


Components:

STL files from Tinkercad:  If you don't have a 3D printer, you can send them off somewhere to have them printed

Adrino sketch: The animitronic will be controlled by an ESP32, that way you can set it outside and not have it connected to your computer.

vbNet program: For creating the data files required by the ESP32.
